I'm a **big** open-source fan. Therefore, I open-source as much of my code as I
can. Feel free to look around on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nloomans),
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/nloomans) and [sourcehut](https://git.sr.ht/~nloomans).
Below you can view some of my favorite projects!

# PWS

For my school's _profielwerkstuk_, Joppe Koers and I made a robot that you can pay
using Ethereum (an alternative for Bitcoin).

We also submitted our _profielwerkstuk_ to the 3i Awards. The 3i Awards will hand
out a price to the best _profielwerkstuk_ (in the Netherlands) with an ICT
component. On the 18th of April, 2018, we got 1st place for best HAVO
_profielwerkstuk_! It was an amazing experience that I will never forget.

# Metis Rooster

I created a schedule page for my school out of frustration. The old schedule
page was incredibly difficult to use, especially on mobile! I started this
project the 4th of September, 2016. On the 8th of October, my school decided to
use my improved schedule page instead of their old one. This project is still
in active development.

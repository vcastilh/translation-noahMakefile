Hi,

I like writing code. I enjoy writing low-level C code, building servers, making
webapps, and learning how stuff really works. Oh, and I'm in love with
robotics. I'm currently studying at [Codam Coding College](https://www.codam.nl/)
and I went to high school at the awesome [Metis Montessori Lyceum](https://hetmml.nl/).
